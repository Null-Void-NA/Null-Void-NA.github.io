    <p>Weapons of various types have been around since the birth of humanity. As humans have evolved, so have their methods of inflicting grievous injuries on one another. One of the most iconic weapons in human history is the humble sword. Throughout the years, swords evolved and have taken various shapes and sizes. Each iteration of the sword helped to further hone its effectiveness in combat and made skillful use of the materials that where available. Some were made to be short and able to be used in close combat in tighter, more compact environments. Some were made to be light and to enable the user to make quick, successive strikes. Others were made to be heavy to tear shields, thin to pierce though armor, or curved to be more effective at slashing. Regardless of their shape, swords have always been a deadly and effective tool, whether for self-defense, or when engaged in war. They have been idolized in history, religion, mythology, fantasy, and pop culture for some time now, and probably will be far into the future. </p>

    <p>Swords are ancient weapons. Swords as we know them came to being sometime around 17 BC, but they weren't the first bladed weapons to be used on the battlefield, weapons like spears, axes, and knives existed far before them. Around 1600 BC is when some of the first swords started being used, in what would later be known as the bronze age. Bronze-era swords are said to be a direct evolution from spears and daggers. One of the first types of bronze swords were rapiers; they were made to be easily handled but were ill-suited for combat due to the brittleness of the materials, which led them to be modified to be more effective.</p>

    <ul>
        <li> Bronze-age Rapiers
            One of the early types of swords from the bronze age were rapiers, but they differed greatly from the flexible, needle-like blade that is commonly used in fencing Today. These swords started to be used around 1600BCE. The bronze rapier was used throughout Europe and was thin and light with a blade that tapered from its handle to a point. Bronze Is a very soft metal, and it therefore wasn’t very suitable for combat as the repeated clashing of swords would cause bronze swords to deteriorate quickly. In 1300 B.C., the design of these swords changed, making them thin towards the handle and wider towards the tip. This made the blade heftier and more durable as well as changing the way the weapon was balanced making it more viable in combat as it able to survive heavier impacts. These weapons were best suited for stabbing, slashing, and thrusting.

        <li>Naue 2 / carp's tongue sword. The Naue type 2 came into use around 1200 BCE and was so popular that it remained until 700 BCE. It was a dual-edged, straight sword that was cast all in one with rivet holes in the handle that allowed for a grip to be added. Previous swords did not have the handles cast along with the blade and instead had rivets at the end of the blade for a handle to be attached, but this would often cause catastrophic failure during combat as the holes would either snap or the rivets would snap after repeated strikes with the blade. The Naue was typically around 27 inches in length and was ideal for use as a cutting and thrusting weapon. This weapon was very popular during the period in which it was used, so much so that it spawned many different variations over time.</li>
